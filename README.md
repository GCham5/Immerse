# Immerse

This is a simple audio visualizer side project that I created to visualize my own personal music. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it allows me to see how the music is playing in real time. The project uses the Web Audio API to extract frequency data from an audio file and uses it to animate shapes on a canvas element. 

## Features

- Real-time audio visualization
- Play, pause, and seek controls
- Circle and bar visualizer options
- Light and dark mode options
- Customizable color scheme

## Usage

To use Immerse, simply follow the [Development](#Development) steps. You can customize the color scheme using the color picker control and toggle between circle and bar visualizer options. You can also toggle between light and dark mode using the sun icon button.

## Development

To build and run Immerse with Vite, first install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

## Credits
The project uses the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and the [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon library.
